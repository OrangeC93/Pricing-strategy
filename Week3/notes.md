## Price elasticities
Why measure price elasticity?
- provides a standard way to predict quantity reactions to price
- can enable us to better understand the competitive structure of the market

- Price elasticity is defined as % change Q/% change P
  - The percent change in quantity divided by the percent change in price
- Cross-price elasticity is the percent change in my quantity divided by the change in some other price
- Income elasticity is the percent change in quatity divided by the percent change in per capita disposable income 

Linear model:

- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Q_{x}"> = an index of beef quantities
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha"> = constant
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_{1}"> = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Px_{1}"> the "own" price of a given type of beef
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_{2}"> = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Px_{2}"> the price of a related good, chicken
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_{3}"> = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Px_{3}"> measure of disposable after tax income 
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_{4}"> = trend variable (1,2,3,4,...,n)
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e_{i}"> = error term

What can we do with the resultï¼š 
- Calculate price elasticity, cross price elasticity and income elasticity
- Use the estimated model as a demand function
- Compute the optimal price of this cut of beef under different scenarios

Price elasticity is defined as %<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta ">Q/%<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta ">P
- Rearranging: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta ">Q/<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta ">P * P/Q, and we could get the first part of this formulation from linear model, the second part is using the means
- E = -1.15 means a ** A 10% change in price will be associated with 11.5% change in quantity**
