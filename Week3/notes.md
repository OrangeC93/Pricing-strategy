## Price elasticities
Why measure price elasticity?
- provides a standard way to predict quantity reactions to price
- can enable us to better understand the competitive structure of the market

- Price elasticity is defined as % change Q/% change P
  - The percent change in quantity divided by the percent change in price
- Cross-price elasticity is the percent change in my quantity divided by the change in some other price
- Income elasticity is the percent change in quatity divided by the percent change in per capita disposable income 

Linear model: 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Q_{x} = \alpha%2b\beta_{1}X_{1}%2b\beta_{2}X_{2}%2b\beta_{3}X_{3}+%2b\beta_{4}X_{4}%2be_{i}">
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Q_{x}"> = an index of beef quantities
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha"> = constant
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_{1}"> = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Px_{1}"> the "own" price of a given type of beef
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_{2}"> = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Px_{2}"> the price of a related good, chicken
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_{3}"> = <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Px_{3}"> measure of disposable after tax income 
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_{4}"> = trend variable (1,2,3,4,...,n)
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=e_{i}"> = error term

What can we do with the resultï¼š 
- Calculate price elasticity, cross price elasticity and income elasticity
- Use the estimated model as a demand function
- Compute the optimal price of this cut of beef under different scenarios

Price elasticity is defined as %<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta ">Q/%<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta ">P
- Rearranging: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta ">Q/<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\delta ">P * P/Q, and we could get the first part of this formulation from linear model, the second part is using the means
- E = -1.15 means a ** A 10% change in price will be associated with 11.5% change in quantity**

## Cross price elasticity (competitors)
E = -0.84 means these products are complements, a 10% increase in the price of chicken will decrease the demand by about 8.4%

We chould anower which brand is most sensitive to its own price and who is the main competitors for your brand

## Income elasticity
E = -4.64 means the product is inferior good, a 10% increase in disposable income will decrease the demand by about 46%
- <0 , inferior good
- =0, sticky good, for example, gas
- <1 and >0, necessity, for example, snack
- >1, lucxury

## Drivers of price eleasticity
- demand curve
- market share
 - established, large players are less elastic
  - tend to price at a premium
  - select the price umbrella
 - small competitors have higher elasticities
  - tend to undercut market leaders
  - have opportunity to gain share
 - smalol channels tend to be more elastic
  - online chaneel ofren has lower prices
- competitors prices

## Price Optimization Considering Demand
Formula = (P-MC)Q = (P-MC)(10-2P)

Why is this harder in the real world
- No ones gives you demand
- You might sell through soemone who has their own incentives
- Some things are illegal

How do we get demand?
- Survey
- Conjoint Analysis
- Purchase Data
  - Scanner data (beef sales)
  - Panel data
- Almost all CPG firm subscribe to scanner data services
