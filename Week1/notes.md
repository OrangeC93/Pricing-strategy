## Welcome course
Three lenses of pricing:
- Economics: cost, margin, supply demand, incentives
- Customers: values, willingness, customer sesgment, purchase decision
- Competitiors: next best alternative, market pricess, market share, industry dynamics

The overlap:
- Economics & Customer: price elasticity
- Economics & Competitors: game thoery
- Customer & Competitors: price discrimination

## Basice economic concepts
Basic metrics of pricing: margins and markups:
- Variations on the Cost/Price Relationship
  - Margin% = (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price
  - Selling Price = Cost / (1 - %Margin)

- Markups vs Margins:
  - When expressied in currency, they are exactly the same
  - Markup % =  (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost

The relationship between price and quantity: demand schedules
- Profit = Quatity * (Price - Cost)

Cost, Cost variations and supply curves: the reasons why we're not using a cost variations and supply curves:
- It applys in microecnomics not a single company which we usually care about.
- It images a perfectly competitive market, but in fact we sometimes set up the price based on other vendors.
- It applys the situation when cost never changes however in most cases the per unit cost will go up if we produce a lot (we need to run factories and pay people overtime)

## Basic pricing mechanism: auctions
English auction, dutch action, sealed bid action (first: works well when there is a lot of variance in the private values vs second: get buyers to bid their actual valuation, instead of shading their bid downward, works well when there is less variance), b2b actions
