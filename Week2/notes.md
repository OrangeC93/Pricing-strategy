## Cost-plus pricing
full cost per unit (total variable cost + total fixed cost) + markup = **selling price**

When is cost plus pricing useful
- situations where sellers have sufficient pricing power
- transactions with very custom specifications and outcomes
- industries with regulated prices
- Starting point to set the price for a new product

## Target cost  pricing
with target cost pricing, buyers set a product's price
- **target cost per unit** = market price per unit - target margin

## Price discrimination based on cost variation
Why do sellers discriminate when settign prices
- improve margins
- incentivize buyers to buy differently or more
- sell to new customer segments

Cost-based price discrimination helps sellers to optimize margins
- high cost: seller passes cost plus additional markup throught to buyer
- lower cost: seller passes only part of cost saving through to buyer

## Price and margin waterfall

## Product line pricing principles
- Larger size products should have a lower price on a per-unit basis than smaller size product 
- The size of the per-unit price discount should be greater if people consume more of the item when they have a larger quatity on hand
- The size of the per-unit price discount should be lower if the economic or psychological cost of an out of stock situation are high
