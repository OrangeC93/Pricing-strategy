## Double Marginalization
What is double marginalization: I charge one price and my channel intermediary charges a price that I think it's too high and depresses my own profit, so that's one problem.

Solution: Manufacture offers a quatity discount to incentivize their channel intermediaries to push out more product

But the distributor will game it, they may buy a lot at the discount price then jack up the price over a long period because they know they cannot sell that many of them.

Dangers of volume discounts:
- Forward buying, diverting
- Larger, more powerful custoemr take advantage of small customers
- Accounting cofusion about costs, margins, prices

## CLV
- NPV: used to evaluate investments and companies
- CLV: used to evaluate customer relationships
- CLV is the expected NPV of the cash flows from the customer relationship

CLV = the discounted sum of all future customer revenue streams - product, servicing adn marketing costs

## Purchase occasion probabilities
![image](/pic/purchase_occasion_probability.png)
- customer segmantation: most valued(reward), second tier(grow)

Early segmentation is possible
- size of the first order
- early subsequent orders
- zip code (economic status)

Challenges with CLV
- Go far back into the data to get the accurate purchase occasion probabilites
- New customers may behave differently than old customers and you're using historical data

## Pricing methods
Marginal cost = chagne in cost/change in quantity

Marginal cost pricing:
- marginal cost $40  + markup% 20% = selling price $48

When to use:
- Fill unsued capacity
- Add to revenue to profits
- Enter a market or create chances for cross-selling

## Marginal cost pricing example

## Peak load pricing
uber example: bring market back into equilibrium by balancing supply and demand
- riders: choose alternative transportation
- driver: incentive


when does it makes sense to use?
- goods and services that cannot be stored
- capacity is constrained
- demand is volatile
- congestion leads to unwanted consequences

eg: mail delievery, electric power

## Index based pricing

when to use
- long term contracts
- low margin business
- cost structure dominated by few big cost items
- cost is volatile
