What is double marginalization: I charge one price and my channel intermediary charges a price that I think it's too high and depresses my own profit, so that's one problem.

But the distributor will game it, they may buy a lot at the discount price then jack up the price over a long period because they know they cannot sell that many of them.

Dangers of volume discounts:
- Forward buying, diverting
- Larger, more powerful custoemr take advantage of small customers
- Accounting cofusion about costs, margins, prices
